# Nebula PS1 Experiment Ledger

Append-only implementation and optimisation experiments. Negative and failed results are retained.

## Experiment schema

Each entry records timestamp, experiment ID, hypothesis, dataset hash, scenario, code commit, solver and version, parameters, seed, workers, time limit, feasibility evidence, objective components, best bound, runtime, output hashes, result, and next decision. Missing fields are written as `not available`, never inferred.

## 2026-09-18

No executable experiments have completed yet. The organiser-supplied Scenario A output is a regression fixture, not a result produced by our solver and not a locally reference-validator-confirmed incumbent.

### E001: Independent public-fixture baseline

- Timestamp: 2026-09-18 22:35:51 +08
- Hypothesis: schema-driven corridor expansion and the published score formula can reproduce the organiser fixture without public-activity special cases.
- Dataset hash: `e6608a9b396df162a6cf9ed74527c493eb07edf1ff89cc81f6906771c82f2188`
- Submission hash: `eb51ad2e0282a2d2a90d5a343ce18d7791327c6b84700e198dd810f763b0dfde`
- Scenario: A
- Code commit: uncommitted working tree
- Solver: none; independent parser and partial checker
- Seed, workers, time limit, bound: not applicable
- Result: 192 access rows expand to exactly 928 distinct required occupancy rows. All 13 implemented rule families pass. Derived penalty is `48.3`, comprising 42 Priority-3 activity overrun-days with activity-priority nudges. ECLO and excess access nights are both zero.
- Runtime: unit suite 0.006 seconds on the local machine; not a performance benchmark.
- Evidence: three passing `unittest` regressions and deterministic CLI output.
- Limitation: closure and buffer compatibility is deliberately unverified because the reference expander and validator are unavailable. This is not a validator-confirmed incumbent and not our solver's output.
- Decision: retain the sample as a regression fixture; proceed to mutation tests and an exact solver only after protecting this evidence boundary.

### E002: Unconstrained-closure Scenario A relaxation

- Timestamp: 2026-09-18 22:38:56 +08
- Hypothesis: the resource-independent `25.2` bound is reachable once workload, starts, predecessors, local possession mixes, nominal capacity, weekly allocation, workfronts, and the exact published penalty are co-optimised.
- Dataset hash: `e6608a9b396df162a6cf9ed74527c493eb07edf1ff89cc81f6906771c82f2188`
- Submission hash: `1903477cfbd54eb471d5f79480e911d3d52873e4412be5c5066efcb7969107a5`
- Scenario: A
- Code commit: uncommitted working tree
- Solver: OR-Tools CP-SAT 9.15.6755
- Parameters: 20-second limit, seed 1, 8 workers, public sample used only as a solution hint
- Result: `OPTIMAL` for the relaxation at `25.2`, with matching best bound. Model size was 21,065 variables and 44,257 constraints. Solver wall time was 0.428 seconds.
- Independent screen: rejected. The sample-consistent closure screen found eight conflicts, including A075 against A036 and A047 in week 28.
- Decision: quarantine permanently as a lower-bound witness. It is neither a feasible incumbent nor a submission candidate.

### E003: Minimal late-row Scenario A repair

- Timestamp: 2026-09-18 22:44:45 +08
- Hypothesis: the avoidable sample penalties from A035 and A038 can be removed without perturbing any already-on-time access or any other activity.
- Dataset hash: `e6608a9b396df162a6cf9ed74527c493eb07edf1ff89cc81f6906771c82f2188`
- Submission hash: `e290bd7fde77480cf4e7c804860b15c9376d34475568b2e6fd58c924770213e9`
- Scenario: A
- Code commit: uncommitted working tree
- Solver: OR-Tools CP-SAT 9.15.6755
- Parameters: 20-second limit, seed 1, 8 workers; freeze every non-target activity; preserve every on-time sample access for A035 and A038; allow only their late rows to move
- Result: `OPTIMAL` for the repair model at `32.2`, with matching best bound. A035 week 27 moved to week 11; A038 week 27 moved to week 26. All other activity weeks remained fixed. Solver wall time was 0.066 seconds.
- Checks: 192 access rows, 928 occupancy rows, complete workload, dates, predecessors, local legal mixes, capacity, allocations, workfronts, results, score, and the sample-consistent closure screen all pass. Six regression tests pass.
- Output hashes: `SCHEDULE_ACCESS.csv` `0adcb58e9d9eddfc5f7192fd38caa0b1c4a70820197a3772993fc6e75ddfb885`; `SCHEDULE_OCCUPANCY.csv` `67974be64e27bb7328c6e86e0a88bb07c5ae5ffdca1fade670bd67cabd2a49e2`; `RESULTS.csv` `9eca188c07c21438f3b1adc03cb83bb7ec0264f0a816756f9293c565bbc0ae1a`.
- Lower-bound argument: A036 requires seven standard weekly accesses from its week-22 planned start, so it occupies the H01 eastbound boundary through week 28. A075 is a Live PM at BET H01-H02 westbound, starts in week 24, and mirrors closure through the interchange. It therefore cannot use weeks 24-28 alongside A036 under the sample-consistent closure semantics and must incur at least seven days of delay. Adding A075's `7.0` to the independent A036/A059 bound of `25.2` yields `32.2`.
- Limitation: the official reference validator has not confirmed either the inferred closure screen or the lower-bound proof. This candidate is protected as the best internally checked result, not as a validator-confirmed incumbent.
- Decision: preserve E003 unchanged; next seek validator confirmation and independently attack the closure interpretation and `32.2` lower bound.
